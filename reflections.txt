# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
about 4 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
the process to uncomment the test code and then fix the errors one bye one.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  a) function to change the priority
  b) makes the high priority items blink
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I wish I were more familiar with the Ruby docs and syntax. It could save me a lot of time. For example, I find both @instance_variable and instance_variable works in its class. I'm not sure which one is better. I'd also the dear reviewer or coach give me some feedback based on my code.
